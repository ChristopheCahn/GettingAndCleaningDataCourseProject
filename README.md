# Getting And Cleaning Data Course Project

## Objective

This repo provides answer to the Coursera MOOC "Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project", part of the Data Science Specialization, John Hopkins University.

## Recall the Context

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example [this article](http://www.insideactivitytracking.com/data-science-activity-tracking-and-the-battle-for-the-worlds-top-sports-brand/) . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

The repository also contains a [CodeBook](https://github.com/ChristopheCahn/GettingAndCleaningDataCourseProject/blob/master/CodeBook.md) presenting the data.

## Instructions

The routine `run_analysis.R` builds two datasets :

- `data`: which contains raw data.

- `meanData`: which presents average values of features in tidy form.
